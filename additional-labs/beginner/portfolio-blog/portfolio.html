  	<h3>What I've Learned</h3>
  	<p>
  	When I think about these projects I have worked, I'm not solely reminded of all the hard work and hours of dedication I have put in. I'm reminded of all the great teams I've encountered and had the pleasure to work with. People from all over with much experience to enlighten my coding skills. I have become a better web developer and a better person because of them. My early experience has taught me a lot and I plant to bring that knowledge to my future teams.
